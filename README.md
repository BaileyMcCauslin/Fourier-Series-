# Fourier-Series
This goal of this project is to help my understanding of Fourier Series and their applications in computer science. 

I started with one of the most simplest forms of a Fourier Series called the "Square Wave". 

The formula is as stated: 

$$
f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1,3,5,\dots}^N \frac{1}{n} \sin{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)}
$$
